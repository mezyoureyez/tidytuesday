#Project Plan: Conduct stepwise regression analysis to identify variables that predict total amount spent; create shiny dashboard to highligh only those variables

#Load packages and data
library(tidyverse)

#Load the data
diwali <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-11-14/diwali_sales_data.csv')

#Group by user because there are multiple rows per user
diwali_total_plus <- diwali %>%
  group_by(User_ID, Gender, Age, Marital_Status, Product_Category, Occupation) %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(Amount)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Gender, Age, Marital_Status, Product_Category, Occupation, total_amount)

#Ensure categorical variables are treated as factors
diwali_total_plus$Gender = as.factor(diwali_total_plus$Gender)
diwali_total_plus$Occupation = as.factor(diwali_total_plus$Occupation)
diwali_total_plus$Product_Category = as.factor(diwali_total_plus$Product_Category)


library(MASS)
fullModel = lm(total_amount ~ ., data = diwali_total_plus) # model with all 9 variables
nullModel = lm(total_amount ~ 1, data = diwali_total_plus) # model with the intercept only
summary(stepAIC(fullModel, # start with a model containing all the variables
                direction = 'backward', # run backward selection
                scope = list(upper = fullModel, # the maximum to consider is a model with all variables
                             lower = nullModel), # the minimum to consider is a model with no variables
                trace = 0)) # do not show the step-by-step process of model selection

#Result: Adjusted r-squared of .59 with just Gender and Product_category as lone predictors
